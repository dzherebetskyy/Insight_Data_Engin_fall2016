Written by Danylo Zherebetskyy in Python on November 13,2016 for Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge

Written code: antifraud.py

New zip-master with passed predesigned tests and own created tests: coding-challenge-master_DZ.zip [Sun Nov 13]

Requires to: import sys

Works with data up to 1GB

Somehow the run_tests.sh in insight_testsuite/ removes my code from the src directory and all the generated data-files (output1.txt, output2.txt, output3.txt), so in the result it does not pass the grader. Need to fix this problem.
